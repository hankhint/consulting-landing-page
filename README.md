# Hori seon Landing Page


## Description 

Horiseon is a Search Engine Optimization service.  This page is their landing page.  It was kind of a mess before I got my hands on it.  Especially the css.
The HTML lacked semantic tags, but I added them.  The CSS had many redundancies, which is a good thing in cloud computing, but bad in this case.  I consolidated a lot of the tags.  I made this readme, I screenshotted the screenshot.

## Real Accessibility
Horiseon's header has some weird coloring for colorblind people like me.  I couldn't see that it said SEO in the title, so I thought it was a really strange name until I started consolidating the HTML and saw the text in side the tag. Some higher contrast colors might be more effective.

## Why The Repo is called urbanOcto
I could have sworn I read that this Challenge had a scenario where I was hired by a company called Urban Octogan.  But, I must have been dreaming because I can't find that anywhere now.
